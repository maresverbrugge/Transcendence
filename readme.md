## Tech Stack

This is a full-stack single-page web application built using NestJS (backend), [ADD FRONTEND HERE] (frontend), PostgreSQL (database), and Docker (environment).

### Docker Container Setup

In our project, we've adopted a containerized approach using Docker to ensure consistent and portable deployment. We've set up three containers, each serving a distinct role:

**Backend Container:**

- This container hosts the backend of our application powered by NestJS.
- It's configured to run on port 3000 within the container.
  
**Frontend Container:**

- The frontend of our application, built with [ADD FRAMEWORK], resides within this container.
- The container is configured to listen on port 8080.

**Database Container:**

- Our PostgreSQL database is contained within this Docker container.
- The container communicates via port [ADD PORT].
