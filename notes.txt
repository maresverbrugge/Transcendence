- Any password stored in your database must be hashed.
- Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm
- For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env

git.  Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure
of the project.
- The user must login using the OAuth system of 42 intranet.
- The user should be able to enable two-factor authentication. For instance,
Google Authenticator or sending a text message to their phone.
